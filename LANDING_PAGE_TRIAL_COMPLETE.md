- **Email uses Resend API** - ensure RESEND_API_KEY is set in environment
- **Magic link expires in 15 minutes** - can be adjusted in existing code
- **Landing page uses pure HTML/CSS/JS** - no external library dependencies
- **Trial emails are beautifully branded** - matches landing page aesthetics
- **Returning users can restart trial** - refreshes trial dates if they sign up again
