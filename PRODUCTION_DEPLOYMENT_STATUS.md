## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After Railway deploys (wait 2-3 minutes):

### Test 1: Basic Email Sending

```
REQUEST: POST /api/auth/send-magic-link
BODY: { email: "test@example.com" }
LOGS: Should show:
  ✅ 📧 EMAIL SEND ATTEMPT STARTED
  ✅ To: test@example.com
  ✅ From: VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>
  ✅ Subject: [visible in logs]
  ✅ 📤 Calling Resend API...
  ✅ ✅ EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY
  ✅ Resend ID: [id]
```

### Test 2: Email Delivery

```
ACTION: Check inbox
EXPECTED: Magic link email arrives in < 5 seconds
VERIFY: Link format is correct
```

### Test 3: Authentication

```
ACTION: Click magic link
EXPECTED: Logged in
RESULT: Chat page loads
```

---

## 🔍 IF SOMETHING FAILS

**Scenario 1: No email arrives**

```
CHECK: Railway logs for ❌ EMAIL SEND FAILED
LOOK FOR: Error Code (INVALID_API_KEY, unverified_domain, etc)
FIX: See EMERGENCY_EMAIL_FIX_DEPLOYED.md for solutions
```

**Scenario 2: Logs show nothing**

```
CHECK: App is deployed and running
CHECK: Endpoint is reachable
CHECK: Request body has email field
```

**Scenario 3: Error "Resend client not initialized"**

```
CAUSE: RESEND_API_KEY not set
FIX: Add to Railway environment variables
RESTART: Service after adding variable
```

## 🎨 LOG FORMAT REFERENCE

### Success Log Flow

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📧 EMAIL SEND ATTEMPT STARTED
To: recipient@example.com
From: VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>
Subject: Your VERA Login Link
Type: transactional
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📤 Calling Resend API...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY
Resend ID: email_12345abc...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Failure Log Flow

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ EMAIL SEND FAILED
Error Message: [specific error]
Error Name: [Error type]
Error Code: [Code]
Status Code: [HTTP status]
Response Status: [if available]
Response Data: [full response]
Full Error Object: [complete details]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 🎯 CRITICAL INFO

### Environment Variables Required

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_FROM=VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>
APP_URL=https://your-vera-domain.com
```

### Critical Dependencies

- ✅ Resend API (external service)
- ✅ Magic link token generation (internal)
- ✅ User database (local)

### What's NOT Dependent on Logs

- ✅ User creation still works
- ✅ Trial accounts still created
- ✅ Magic links still generated
- ✅ Authentication still works

Only email delivery shows detailed logs now (cleaner, safer).
