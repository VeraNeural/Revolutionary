## 🔌 New API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/auth/send-trial-magic-link`

This is what the landing page calls when user clicks "Begin Your Journey":

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/send-trial-magic-link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@example.com"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Check your email for your 48-hour trial link. It expires in 15 minutes."
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates email format
2. Creates new user with trial status (if new)
3. OR refreshes trial for returning users
4. Generates 15-minute magic link token
5. Sends beautiful branded email
6. Returns success message
