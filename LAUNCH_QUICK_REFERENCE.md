## NEXT: TWO QUICK SETUP STEPS

### Step 1️⃣: Add Sentry DSN to Railway (5 minutes)

```
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click VERA project
3. Click Settings → Variables
4. Click "New Variable"
5. Name: SENTRY_DSN
   Value: https://935430dac18be41f01450146e9b7ec7a@o4510263035035648.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510263036608512
6. Click Save
7. Wait for auto-redeploy (2-3 minutes)
8. Done! ✓
```

**Verify it works:**
- Go to https://sentry.io
- Open VERA-Production project
- Should see "Connected" status

---

### Step 2️⃣: Test Backup & Schedule (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test backup
npm run db:backup

# Should create: ./backups/vera-backup-2024-10-27T14-30-00.sql
# File size: ~2-3 MB
# Done! ✓
```

Then schedule daily backups:
- **Via Railway Cron:**
  1. Railway → Project Settings → Cron Jobs
  2. New job: name=`daily-backup`, schedule=`0 3 * * *`, command=`npm run db:backup`
  3. Enable and done! ✓

- **Via your own cron:**
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  # Add: 0 3 * * * cd /path/to/vera-project && npm run db:backup
  ```
