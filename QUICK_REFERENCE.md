# âš¡ QUICK REFERENCE - EMAIL COLLECTION FIX

## ðŸ”´ THE PROBLEM (Explained Simply)

Guest users could chat forever without being asked for their email.

**Why?** The system never marked them as "guest" so message counting never started.

---

## âœ… THE FIX (What Changed)

**File:** `public/chat.html` (20 lines added)

**Added:** When page loads, if user NOT logged in:

```
localStorage.veraIsGuest = 'true'
guestMessageCount = 0
```

**Result:** Now message counting works for guests.
