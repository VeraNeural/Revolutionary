### Issue #1: Email Collection Modal Not Triggering ✅
**Commit:** `46aea8b`
- Root cause: Guest flag never initialized
- Fix: Set `localStorage.veraIsGuest = 'true'` on page load
- Impact: Email modal now shows after 4 messages

### Issue #2: Email Delivery Completely Broken ✅

## 🔴 WHAT WAS WRONG

### Problem 1: Guest Email Collection
```
User opens incognito
    ↓
Chats forever without email prompt ❌
    ↓
NO revenue, NO trial, NO authenticated users
```

**Root cause:** `localStorage.veraIsGuest` was never set

### Problem 2: Email Delivery
```
User tries to sign up
    ↓
Magic link email sent from: vera@revolutionary-production.up.railway.app ❌
    ↓
Resend rejects (domain not verified)
    ↓
Email never arrives ❌
    ↓
User can't authenticate, can't start trial
```

**Root cause:** Railway domains aren't verified with Resend

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED

### Fix #1: Guest Flag Initialization
**File:** `public/chat.html` (Lines 2300-2330)

```javascript
// For unauthenticated users
localStorage.setItem('veraIsGuest', 'true');
guestMessageCount = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('veraGuestMessageCount') || '0');

// For authenticated users
localStorage.removeItem('veraIsGuest');
localStorage.removeItem('veraGuestMessageCount');
```

**Result:** Message counting now works, email modal appears after 4 messages

### Fix #2: Email Domain Verification
**File:** `server.js` (Lines 103-159)

**Changed from:**
```javascript
from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM || 'vera@revolutionary-production.up.railway.app'
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
// Validate Resend client
if (!resend) {
  throw new Error('Resend client not initialized');
}

// Use verified domain
const emailFrom = process.env.EMAIL_FROM || 'VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>';

const data = await resend.emails.send({
  from: emailFrom,
  to: to,
  subject: subject,
  html: html,
});
```

**Result:** Emails now send successfully from verified domain

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Email not sending?
1. Check RESEND_API_KEY is set
2. Check server logs: `❌ Email send failed`
3. Look for errorCode/errorName
4. Check Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/emails

### Modal not appearing after 4 messages?
1. Check console: `👤 Guest mode enabled`
2. Check: `localStorage.getItem('veraIsGuest')` = `"true"`
3. Check message count: `localStorage.getItem('veraGuestMessageCount')` incrementing

### Trial not starting after email?
1. Check magic link was clicked
2. Check database: user has `subscription_status = 'trial'`
3. Check: `trial_starts_at` date is set
