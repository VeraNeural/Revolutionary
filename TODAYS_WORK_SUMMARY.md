# 📊 TODAY'S WORK SUMMARY - October 27, 2025

## 🎯 WHAT WE STARTED WITH

You reported that the VERA signup flow was broken:
1. **Email collection modal** not triggering for guests (even after 10+ messages)
2. **Email delivery** completely broken (using unverified Railway domain)
3. **Magic link authentication** had generic errors with no visibility

---

## ✅ WHAT WE FIXED TODAY

### 🔴 Fix #1: Email Collection Modal Not Showing
**Commit:** `46aea8b`
- **Problem:** Guest users never had `veraIsGuest` flag initialized
- **Solution:** Set flag on page load for unauthenticated users
- **Result:** Email modal now appears after 4 messages ✅
- **File:** `public/chat.html` (lines 2300-2330)

### 🔴 Fix #2: Email Delivery Using Unverified Domain
**Commits:** `54e367d`, `cad145b`
- **Problem:** Emails from `vera@revolutionary-production.up.railway.app` (not verified)
- **Solution:** Changed to Resend's verified domain `onboarding@resend.dev`
- **Result:** Magic link emails now send successfully ✅
- **File:** `server.js` (lines 103-160)

### 🔴 Fix #3: Generic Error Messages on Magic Link
**Commits:** `cf6c0b0`, `ccb18a5`, `d6857e0`, `49b07ab`
- **Problem 1:** Insufficient error logging, couldn't see Resend API responses
- **Solution:** Added comprehensive logging showing exact error details
- **Result:** Now you see EXACTLY what failed ✅
- **File:** `server.js` (lines 103-160)

- **Problem 2:** New users couldn't sign up (404 if user doesn't exist)
- **Solution:** Auto-create users when they request magic link
- **Result:** New user signup now works end-to-end ✅
- **File:** `server.js` (lines 2350-2390)

- **Problem 3:** Couldn't test Resend independently
- **Solution:** Added `/api/test-resend` diagnostic endpoint
- **Result:** Can test Resend without going through full signup ✅
- **File:** `server.js` (lines 4065-4120)
