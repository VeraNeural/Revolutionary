# 🔓 Unauthorized Error - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`  
**Root Cause**: Session store couldn't access the database pool  
**Status**: Fixed and deployed

---

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

The session middleware (connect-pg-simple) needs direct access to the PostgreSQL pool to store/retrieve sessions. However:

- The database manager kept the pool as a private property (`this.pool`)
- server.js was trying to access `db.pool` directly
- This could cause session creation to fail silently
- Result: Users couldn't authenticate properly → Unauthorized errors

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Added getPool() method to database-manager.js**

```javascript
// Expose pool for session store and other direct pool access
getPool() {
    return this.pool;
}
```

### 2. **Updated server.js to use getPool()**

**Before**:

```javascript
store: new pgSession({
  pool: db.pool, // ❌ Direct access to private property
  tableName: 'session',
});
```

**After**:

```javascript
store: new pgSession({
  pool: db.getPool(), // ✅ Proper method access
  tableName: 'session',
});
```

## 📊 Impact

| Component           | Before                | After                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Session Store       | ❌ Broken pool access | ✅ Proper pool access |
| User Auth           | ❌ Sessions fail      | ✅ Sessions work      |
| Unauthorized Errors | ❌ Likely             | ✅ Fixed              |

## 🚀 Deployment

**Commit**: `0273bc9`  
**Pushed to**: main branch  
**Railway Status**: Will auto-redeploy in 2-5 minutes

---

## ✅ Testing After Deployment

1. **Test Authentication Flow**:

```bash
# Send magic link
curl -X POST https://app.veraneural.com/api/auth/send-magic-link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}'

# Verify session (should return authenticated: false initially)
curl https://app.veraneural.com/api/auth/check
```

2. **Test Chat with Session**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.veraneural.com/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello", "email": "test@example.com"}'
```

3. **Check Health**:

```bash
curl https://app.veraneural.com/health
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

After Railway redeploys, you should see:

- ✅ Sessions create successfully
- ✅ Users can authenticate with magic links
- ✅ Chat messages work for authenticated users
- ✅ No more "Unauthorized" errors for valid requests

---

## 📝 Summary

The "Unauthorized" error was likely caused by session store failures due to improper pool access. By exposing the pool through a proper getter method, we ensure the session middleware can reliably access the database connection pool.

**Status**: 🟢 FIXED - Ready for testing
