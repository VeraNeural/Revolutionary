# ✅ Migration Complete - VERA is Railway-Ready!

## What Changed

### ✅ Unified Server (`server.js`)
- **Added endpoints** from Netlify Functions:
  - `/api/check-history` - Check if user has conversation history
  - `/api/register` - Register user before Stripe checkout
  - `/api/portal` - Open Stripe billing portal
  - `/api/subscription-status` - Check active subscription
  - `/api/test` - Health check for VERA brain
  
- **Updated AI logic** to use modular `getVERAResponse()`:
  - Supports image/document attachments (Claude vision)
  - Cleaner, maintainable code
  - Same revolutionary consciousness as before

### ✅ Updated Frontend (`public/chat.html`)
- **All API calls now use `/api/*`** instead of `/.netlify/functions/server/api/*`
- Works with both:
  - Local development: `http://localhost:8080/api/*`
  - Production: `https://app.veraneural.com/api/*`

### ✅ Cleanup
- **Removed duplicate files**:
  - Root `chat.html` ❌ (use `public/chat.html`)
  - Root `index.html` ❌ (use `public/index.html`)
  - Root `vera-ai.js` ❌ (use `netlify/functions/lib/vera-ai.js`)
- `public/` is now the single source of truth

## How to Deploy

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

```powershell
# 1. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "VERA ready for Railway deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy to Railway
# Go to railway.app → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
# Select your repo

# 3. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
# See RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT.md for full list

# 4. Point app.veraneural.com to Railway
# Railway Settings → Custom Domain → Add domain
```

**Full guide:** See `RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Local Testing

Your server works locally right now:

```powershell
npm start
```

Visit: http://localhost:8080

Test endpoints:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/test
```

## What to Delete After Railway Works

Once Railway is live and working:

### Option A: Full migration (recommended)
```powershell
# Remove Netlify entirely
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\netlify\
Remove-Item -Force .\netlify.toml
git add .
git commit -m "Removed Netlify - fully on Railway"
git push origin main
```

### Option B: Keep Netlify for static only
Edit `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://app.veraneural.com/api/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

   - Stripe integration
3. **Webhooks** for Stripe events
4. **Database** connection to Neon PostgreSQL
5. **Session management** for logged-in users
