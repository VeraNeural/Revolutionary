## ðŸ“‹ KNOWN ISSUES & NOTES

### Minor Items (Non-Blocking)

1. **Old magic-link auth** (`/login.html`) - Still exists but not linked to new flow
   - **Impact:** None (users directed to new password auth)
   - **Action:** Can remove in next cleanup

2. **Community/Professional pages** hardcoded URLs
   - **Impact:** Work on production, fail on localhost
   - **Action:** Can be fixed to use dynamic pricing router

### What Was NOT Changed (Per Request)

- âœ… Backend API endpoints (left intact)
- âœ… Server routing (no modifications)
- âœ… Database schema (no changes)
- âœ… `/intro`, `/community`, `/professional` pages (unchanged)
- âœ… Chat.html logic (only UI elements referenced)
