## What You Now Have

âœ… **Automated migrations** - Run automatically on Railway deployment  
âœ… **Manual script** - Can run anytime: `node run-migrations.js`  
âœ… **No psql needed** - Everything is Node.js  
âœ… **Zero manual steps** - Just `git push`

## One-Time Setup: Nothing!

Just push to Railway:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Done. Migrations run automatically.

## To Deploy Your Magic Link Fix

### Step 1: Push Code

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Watch Deployment

- Railway dashboard â†’ Deployments
- Look for: `ðŸ”„ Running database migrations...`
- Look for: `âœ… Migrations complete:`

### Step 3: Verify

- Go to Railway database console
- Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM magic_links;`
- Should return: `(1 row)`

---

## Manual Migration (if needed)

```bash
# Set your database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"

# Run migrations
node run-migrations.js

# Output:
# âœ… Loaded migrations file
# âœ… Parsed 12 SQL statements
# âœ… Migrations complete: 10 executed, 2 skipped
```

---

## How It Works

**On Deployment:**

1. `git push` â†’ Railway builds
2. `server.js` starts
3. Detects `DATABASE_URL` is set (production)
4. Automatically runs `DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.sql`
5. Creates 3 tables: `magic_links`, `email_delivery_logs`, `login_audit_log`
6. Creates 9 indexes
7. Server starts listening
8. Ready to accept requests

**In Development:**

1. `DATABASE_URL` not set
2. Migrations skipped
3. Server starts normally
4. Use test database

---

## That's It!

- âœ… No psql needed
- âœ… No manual SQL
- âœ… No additional setup
- âœ… Completely automated

Just deploy normally with `git push origin main`

## Documentation

- **Full Guide**: `MIGRATION_SCRIPT_GUIDE.md`
- **Summary**: `MIGRATION_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`
- **Deployment**: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

---

## Testing Locally (Optional)

```bash
# Check script syntax
node --check run-migrations.js

# Check server syntax
node --check server.js

# Both should output nothing (meaning OK)
```

---

## Exit Codes

```
node run-migrations.js
echo $?  # 0 = success, 1 = failure
```

---

**Ready?** Just push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Migrations run automatically on Railway. Done! ðŸŽ‰
