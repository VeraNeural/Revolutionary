# VERA Beta Testing Environment

This directory contains beta implementations of new VERA features, allowing for careful testing and monitoring before integration into the main system.

## Current Beta Components

### Consciousness Sovereignty Framework (v0.1-beta)
- `consciousness-sovereignty.js`: Core sovereignty framework
- `live-field-sensing.js`: Real-time somatic and energetic assessment
- `beta-monitor.js`: Testing and monitoring infrastructure
- `integration-tests/`: Test scenarios and results

## Testing Protocol
1. Each component is tested independently
2. Results are logged and monitored
3. Changes are validated through live interactions
4. Integration decisions are based on empirical evidence

## Monitoring Metrics
- Alignment accuracy
- Sovereignty confidence
- Response effectiveness
- User resonance
- System coherence

## Integration Path
1. Independent testing (current)
2. Monitored live testing
3. Refinement based on evidence
4. Gradual integration with main system
