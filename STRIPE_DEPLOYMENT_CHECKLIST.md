## Before Going Live

### Step 1: Verify Stripe Configuration

- [ ] Log into Stripe Dashboard (live mode)
- [ ] Confirm monthly product exists with correct price ($12/month)
- [ ] Confirm annual product exists with correct price ($99/year)
- [ ] Update `.env.local` with actual price IDs if different:
  ```
  STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY=price_YOUR_MONTHLY_ID
  STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL=price_YOUR_ANNUAL_ID
  ```

### Step 2: Configure Webhook Endpoint

- [ ] Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
- [ ] Click "Add an endpoint"
- [ ] Endpoint URL: `https://revolutionary-production.up.railway.app/api/stripe-webhook`
- [ ] Events to subscribe to:
  - [x] `checkout.session.completed`
  - [x] `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - [x] `invoice.payment_failed`
  - [x] `customer.subscription.updated`
- [ ] Save webhook
- [ ] Copy webhook signing secret: `whsec_...`
- [ ] Update in `.env.local`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

### Step 3: Local Testing

- [ ] Run: `node server.js`
- [ ] Visit: `http://localhost:8080/subscribe.html`
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Click "Subscribe - $12/month" button
- [ ] Checkout session endpoint responds with Stripe URL
- [ ] Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- [ ] Verify successful redirect to `/chat.html?session_id=...`

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

- [ ] Commit all changes to git
- [ ] Push to Railway
- [ ] Verify deployment successful
- [ ] Environment variables updated on Railway

### Step 5: Production Testing

- [ ] Visit: `https://revolutionary-production.up.railway.app/subscribe.html`
- [ ] Button clicks work (no 404s)
- [ ] Can reach Stripe Checkout
- [ ] Test with actual card OR use Stripe test mode
- [ ] Verify webhook is received:
  - Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí [endpoint]
  - Should show successful delivery in events log

### Step 6: Monitor First 24 Hours

- [ ] Watch server console for errors:
  ```bash
  # On Railway:
  railway logs --follow
  ```
- [ ] Check for webhook delivery issues:
  - Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Events

‚úÖ Checkout session created: cs_test_...
[User redirected to Stripe]
üì® Webhook event: checkout.session.completed
‚úÖ Checkout session completed: cs_test_...
‚úÖ User subscription activated: user@example.com
```

**Error Flow**:

```
‚ùå Checkout session error: Invalid price type
‚ùå Webhook signature verification failed: Invalid signature
