See next section

---

## 🧪 COMPLETE TESTING PROCEDURE

### Test 1: Resend Direct Test (2 minutes) ✅

**Objective:** Verify Resend API is working

**Steps:**
1. Visit: `https://revolutionary-production.up.railway.app/api/test-resend`
2. Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Test email sent successfully!",
     "resendId": "abc123...",
     "result": {...}
   }
   ```
3. Check inbox: `support@veraneural.com` should receive test email
4. Check server logs: Should show `✅ Test email sent successfully`

**If FAILS:**
- Look for: `❌ Resend test failed - FULL ERROR:`
- This shows EXACT problem with Resend
- Common issues:
  - API key invalid
  - From domain unverified
  - Rate limited (unlikely)

---

### Test 2: New User Signup (4 minutes) ✅

**Objective:** Verify new users can signup and get magic link

**Steps:**
1. Go to: `https://revolutionary-production.up.railway.app/`
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Enter NEW email: `testuser+$(date +%s)@example.com`
4. Click "Send sign-in link"
5. Expected success message
6. Check email inbox: Should receive magic link in < 5 seconds
7. Check server logs:
   - Should see: `🆕 New user detected:`
   - Should see: `✅ New user created successfully:`
   - Should see: `✅ Magic link email queued for delivery:`

**If FAILS at signup:**
- Check logs: Look for `❌ RESEND API ERROR - COMPLETE DETAILS:`
- This shows why Resend rejected the email
- Example errors:
  - "unverified_domain" → Domain not verified
  - "invalid_from_address" → FROM address wrong
  - "api_key_invalid" → API key issue

**If FAILS at user creation:**
- Check logs: Look for `❌ Failed to create new user:`
- Database error shown
- Check if users table exists and has right columns

---

### Test 3: Existing User Login (2 minutes) ✅

**Objective:** Verify existing users can still login

**Steps:**
1. Go to: `https://revolutionary-production.up.railway.app/`
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Enter email: any email you've used before OR from Test 2
4. Click "Send sign-in link"
5. Expected success message
6. Check server logs:
   - Should see: `✅ Existing user found:`
   - Should see: `✅ Magic link email queued for delivery:`
7. Check email: Should receive magic link
8. Click link: Should authenticate and see chat

**If FAILS:**
- Check logs for error details
- If user not found in first request, that's expected (Test 2 creates them)

---

### Test 4: Click Magic Link (2 minutes) ✅

**Objective:** Verify magic link authentication works

**Steps:**
1. From Test 2, open email with magic link
2. Click the link
3. Expected: Redirected to `/chat.html` and logged in
4. Should see VERA chatbot ready
5. Can start chatting

**If FAILS:**
- Link doesn't work: Check if token expired (15 minute window)
- Not authenticated: Check browser cookies/session
- Check logs for verify-magic-link errors

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "unverified_domain" error

**Solution:**
1. Go to Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/domains
2. Check if `veraneural.com` is verified
3. If not, add it and follow verification steps
4. Fallback: Use test domain temporarily:
   ```bash
   railway variables set EMAIL_FROM="VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>"
   ```

### Issue: "api_key_invalid" error

**Solution:**
1. Check Railroad variables:
   ```bash
   railway variables get RESEND_API_KEY
   ```
2. Should start with `re_`
3. If wrong, get correct key from Resend dashboard and update
4. Restart server after changing

### Issue: "invalid_from_address" error

**Solution:**
1. Check EMAIL_FROM variable:
   ```bash
   railway variables get EMAIL_FROM
   ```
2. Should be: `VERA <support@veraneural.com>`
3. If wrong, update and restart

### Issue: No logs appearing

**Solution:**
1. Check server restarted: Look for startup banner in logs
2. Verify endpoint is active: Look for "API Endpoints Active" section
3. Tail logs in real-time:
   ```bash
   railway logs --tail 100 --follow
   ```

### Issue: User creation fails

**Solution:**
1. Check if `users` table exists
2. Check if has required columns: id, email, subscription_status, created_at, trial_starts_at, trial_ends_at
3. Check database permissions

### Issue: Email doesn't arrive

**Solution:**
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify Resend shows success in logs
3. Check Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/emails
4. Look for delivery status
5. Check SPF/DKIM records (should be provided by Resend)
