# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Resend Email Domain Verification

## 🔴 THE PROBLEM

**Issue:** Email sending was failing because the `from` field used an **unverified Railway domain**.

```javascript
// OLD CODE (Line 113)
from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM || 'vera@revolutionary-production.up.railway.app',
```

**Why it failed:**

- Railway domains are not verified in Resend
- Resend rejects emails from unverified domains
- All magic link emails were failing
- Users couldn't authenticate

---

## ✅ THE FIX

**Changed:** Lines 103-121 in `server.js`

### 1. Added Resend Client Validation

```javascript
// Validate Resend client is initialized
if (!resend) {
  throw new Error('Resend client not initialized');
}
```

### 2. Changed Email Domain to Resend's Verified Test Domain

```javascript
// Before
from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM || 'vera@revolutionary-production.up.railway.app',

// After
const emailFrom = process.env.EMAIL_FROM || 'VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>';

const data = await resend.emails.send({
  from: emailFrom,
  to: to,
  subject: subject,
  html: html,
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging

```javascript
console.error('❌ Email send failed', {
  to,
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM || 'VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>',
  type: emailType,
  error: errorMsg,
  errorCode: error.code,
  errorName: error.name,
  resendError: error.response?.data || error,
  logId,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

## 🚀 WHY THIS WORKS

### Resend's Test Domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`)

- ✅ Pre-verified by Resend
- ✅ Works immediately for testing
- ✅ No setup required
- ✅ Emails send instantly
- ❌ Domain shows "Resend" to recipients

### Production Domain (After Verification)

- Will use `EMAIL_FROM` environment variable
- Example: `noreply@veraneural.com`
- Requires domain verification in Resend dashboard
- Shows your branded domain to recipients

---

## 📋 HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKS

### Test in Development/Local

1. Set environment variable: `RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here`
2. Call the magic link endpoint
3. Check logs: Should see `✅ Email sent successfully`
4. Check Resend dashboard: Email should appear in logs

### Test on Railway Production

1. Restart the server
2. Test email signup
3. Check logs in Railway dashboard
4. Magic link should arrive in seconds

---

## 🔒 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

### For Testing (Current)

No setup needed - uses default: `VERA <onboarding@resend.dev>`

### For Production

Set this in Railway:

```bash
EMAIL_FROM="VERA <noreply@veraneural.com>"
```

Then verify your domain in Resend:

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add `veraneural.com`
3. Follow verification steps
4. Update `EMAIL_FROM` environment variable

## 📈 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Testing)

- [x] Changed domain to `onboarding@resend.dev`
- [x] Added client validation
- [x] Enhanced error logging
- [x] Tested syntax (no errors)
- [ ] Deploy to Railway
- [ ] Test magic link email

### Later (Production)

- [ ] Verify `veraneural.com` in Resend
- [ ] Update `EMAIL_FROM` environment variable
- [ ] Deploy updated code
- [ ] Monitor email delivery

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If emails still don't send after deployment:

1. **Check RESEND_API_KEY**

   ```bash
   railway variables get RESEND_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Check logs**

   ```bash
   railway logs --service server
   ```

   Look for: `❌ Email send failed` with error details

3. **Verify in Resend dashboard**
   - Go to https://resend.com/emails
   - Look for send attempts
   - Check error messages

4. **Test directly**
   - Call `/api/auth/send-magic-link`
   - Check response for errors
   - Look at server logs for debugging info

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

After deployment, verify:

- ✅ Magic link emails arrive in seconds
- ✅ Server logs show: `✅ Email sent successfully`
- ✅ Resend dashboard shows successful sends
- ✅ Users can click magic link and authenticate
- ✅ Trial account automatically created

---

## 📝 NOTES

- This uses Resend's free tier (`onboarding@resend.dev`)
- For production with your domain, you'll need to verify it
- All existing email logic (retry, logging) still works
- No database schema changes needed
- Backwards compatible with existing code

**Status:** ✅ Ready for deployment
**Deployed:** [Date to be filled]
**Testing:** [To be confirmed]
